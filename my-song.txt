And who are you? The proud lord said
That I must bow so low?
Only a cat of a different coat
That's all the truth I know
In a coat of gold or a coat of red
A lion still has claws
Mine are long and sharp my lord
As long and sharp as yours

And so he spoke
And so he spoke
That Lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep over his hall
And not a soul to hear
